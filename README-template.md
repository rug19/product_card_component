## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to do a responsive layout using Flexbox and your properties. 

### Continued development

I want to learn more about HTML and CSS to create a solid base about them, so I'll continue to focus on projects like this to practice. 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Kevin Poweel is a great channel to learn programming, but one of his videos helped me with responsive layouts. I strongly recommend it.
